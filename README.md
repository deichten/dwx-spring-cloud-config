Nothing interesting here. This repo serves as a config repo to [dwx-spring-cloud](https://github.com/deichten/dwx-spring-cloud) and is getting used by the config server.

To start using it I'd suggest you fork this repo and use the fork – with overwritten values for the API-key as well as DB crendetials – as input to your config server.
